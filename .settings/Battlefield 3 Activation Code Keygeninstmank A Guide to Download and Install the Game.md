However, buying a Steam key for Battlefield 3 can be expensive, especially if you missed the Humble Origin Bundle that offered the game for a low price. So, how can you get Battlefield 3 activation code for free? Here are some possible ways:
 
- Look for giveaways or promotions that offer free Steam keys for Battlefield 3. For example, in 2013, EA gave away free codes for Battlefield 3 on Origin using the code G433-XWLD-ZBW8-JWUC-JDSW[^3^]. However, this code was quickly shut off by EA, so you might not be able to find such deals anymore[^3^]. You can also check Reddit or other forums for people who are willing to share their spare codes with others[^3^].
- Contact EA support and ask them to transfer your Battlefield 3 code from your old Origin account to your new one. If you have purchased Battlefield 3 before on a different account and you have lost access to it, you might be able to recover your code by providing proof of purchase to EA advisors[^2^]. However, this might not work if you have used a different email address or payment method for your old account[^2^]. You can contact EA support here: https://help.ea.com/en/contact-us/.
- Use a valid Steam key generator that can create random codes for Battlefield 3. This is a risky and illegal method that might not work at all or might get your account banned by Steam or EA. A Steam key generator is a software that claims to generate valid codes for various games, but most of them are scams or malware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. Moreover, using a generated code might violate the terms of service of Steam or EA and result in legal consequences. Therefore, we do not recommend this method at all.

In conclusion, getting Battlefield 3 activation code for free is not easy or safe. The best way to play the game is to buy it from a legitimate source and support the developers.
