But who is the man behind the music? Fatboy Slim was born as Quentin Leo Cook in 1963 in Bromley, Kent. He grew up with a love of music and played drums in a punk band called Disque Attack when he was a teenager. He later switched to bass guitar and joined the Housemartins, a popular indie rock band that had a number-one hit with their cover of "Caravan of Love" in 1986[^3^]. After the band broke up, Cook moved to Brighton and started experimenting with electronic music, using samples and loops to create catchy tunes. He formed several projects, such as Beats International, Freak Power, Pizzaman, and Mighty Dub Katz, and also became a sought-after remixer for artists like Cornershop, Beastie Boys, and A Tribe Called Quest[^2^].
 
In 1996, he adopted the name Fatboy Slim and released his debut album under that moniker, Better Living Through Chemistry. The album was a hit with critics and clubbers alike, and established Cook as one of the leading figures of the big beat scene, along with acts like The Chemical Brothers and The Prodigy. His second album, You've Come a Long Way, Baby, was even more successful, spawning four Top Ten singles in the UK and earning him a Brit Award for Best British Dance Act in 1999[^2^]. He also became famous for his innovative music videos, directed by Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, and others, which often featured ordinary people doing extraordinary things.
 
Cook continued to release albums and singles throughout the 2000s and 2010s, collaborating with artists like Macy Gray, Bootsy Collins, David Byrne, Iggy Pop, and Riva Starr. He also performed at some of the biggest events in the world, such as the 2012 London Olympics closing ceremony, the 2014 FIFA World Cup final show, and the 2015 Glastonbury Festival. He also hosted his own beach parties in Brighton, attracting hundreds of thousands of fans. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential and respected DJs of all time[^1^].
