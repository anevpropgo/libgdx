The Bee Gees were formed in 1958 by brothers Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb. They were born in England but moved to Australia when they were young. They started their musical career as a pop and rock group, but later switched to disco and soul in the 1970s. They sold over 220 million records worldwide and won numerous awards and honors, including nine Grammy Awards, five American Music Awards and a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.
 
Some of their most famous songs are "To Love Somebody", "Massachusetts", "I Started a Joke", "Words", "Lonely Days", "How Can You Mend a Broken Heart", "Jive Talkin'", "You Should Be Dancing", "Stayin' Alive", "Night Fever", "How Deep Is Your Love", "Tragedy", "Too Much Heaven", "Love You Inside Out" and "You Win Again". They also wrote and produced songs for other artists, such as Barbra Streisand, Diana Ross, Kenny Rogers, Dolly Parton, Celine Dion and Michael Jackson.
 
The Bee Gees had a long and successful career that spanned six decades. They faced many challenges and tragedies, such as the deaths of their younger brother Andy Gibb and Maurice Gibb, as well as the decline of their popularity in the 1980s. However, they never gave up on their music and continued to perform and record until 2012, when Robin Gibb passed away. Barry Gibb is the only surviving member of the group and he still performs solo or with other musicians.
